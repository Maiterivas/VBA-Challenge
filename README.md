# VBA-Challenge

For this homework, I was asked to analyze a workbook with 3 worksheets about annual stock data. 

Using VBA, I was able to make a code to loop through all 3 years of worksheets. 

With this code, I generated summaries of tickers with (on each worksheet):

-Ticker symbol
-Yearly Change of ticker
-Percent Change of ticker
-Color Coded percent change values (green for > 0, red for others)
-Total Stock Volume of ticker


(Bonus)
-Greatest percent increase of ticker in worksheet
-Greatest percent decrease of ticker in worksheet
-Greatest total stock volume of ticker in worksheet

Since I could not upload the original file due to its size, I have linked my .xlsm file using Google Drive:

The screenshots of the resulting summaries for the tickers in each workseet have been uploaded as files in my repository.

There has also been a .vbs file uploaded containing the full VBA script for this homework.
